;## general information/instructions
;#####################################################

;## purpose of this file
	;## this file contains all the strings that are displayed in the script's UIs


;## file structure
	;## the script ignores TABs, empty lines, as well as lines/sections marked as comments (;##)
	;## each non-comment line in this file is a key/value pair, divided into two parts:
		;##	key			=	"value"
		;## the value has to be enclosed in quotation marks


;## how to translate/localize the data in this file
	;## NEVER edit the key of a line, i.e. whatever is left of the equal sign
	;## if a value contains an abbreviation or text-string that's not immediately clear, look for comments or at the key-name for more context (e.g. global_calibrate = "cal")
	;## unlike the client.txt file, this file contains strings that can be freely translated however you see fit


;## some notation remarks
	;## in order to add line-breaks to a string, include ";" in the value, e.g. "line 1;line2"
	;## I often use <> as a replacement for quotation marks because they look better when using Fontin Smallcaps


;## case-sensitivity
	;## I personally prefer to display these strings all lower-case because I think it looks better with Fontin Smallcaps



;#####################################################
;## system-settings
;#####################################################

;## these are some global system-settings that are dependant on the target language
		system_font			=	"Fontin SmallCaps"		;## except for Fontin SmallCaps, the specified font-type has to be installed on the system
											;## this key is also present in the client.txt file, where it takes precedence (i.e. the value there will override this one)

;## credits: translators

;## these names will be shown in a tooltip when hovering over the "credits" label	;## the tooltip is segmented into smaller boxes
		translator			=	"lailloken"			;## you can add additional <contributor> lines, and each value will have its own box

;## these are the individual sections of the settings menu, and most refer to a feature
